# Project6
This project is about BigMart Sales analysis. Here, I used some new concepts using Python programming language like the difference between univariate and multivariate plots. 
and also applied some sikit_learn libraries. In this project, we aim to build a predictive model to determine the sales for each product in a particular store. 
Here, I made the model prediction based on 3 different models; 1st Linear Regression Model, 2nd RandomForest Regressor Model, and 3rd Lasso Regressor Model.
